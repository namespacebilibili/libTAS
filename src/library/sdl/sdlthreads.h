 *  A thread may be "detached" to signify that it should not remain until

 *  is useful for long-running threads that nothing needs to synchronize
 *  with or further manage. When a detached thread is done, it simply
 *  goes away.
 *
 *  There is no way to recover the return code of a detached thread. If you
 *  need this, don't detach the thread and instead use SDL_WaitThread().
 *
 *  Once a thread is detached, you should usually assume the SDL_Thread isn't
 *  safe to reference again, as it will become invalid immediately upon
 *  the detached thread's exit, instead of remaining until someone has called
 *  SDL_WaitThread() to finally clean it up. As such, don't detach the same
 *  thread more than once.
 *
 *  If a thread has already exited when passed to SDL_DetachThread(), it will
 *  stop waiting for a call to SDL_WaitThread() and clean up immediately.
 *  It is not safe to detach a thread that might be used with SDL_WaitThread().
 *
 *  You may not call SDL_WaitThread() on a thread that has been detached.
