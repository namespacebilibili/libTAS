/* There are two ways a program can link to a shared library:
 * either it was compiled with an include of the library header foo.h
 * and using the library as an argument (-lfoo)
 * or it can link using the set of dl functions (dlopen, dlsym, etc.)
 * during the program runtime.
 *
 * In the first case, the functions of the shared library that the game
 * is using are included in the list of symbols of the executable,
 * so by writing a function with the same name and using the LD_PRELOAD trick,
 * the game will call our function instead of the original.
 *
 * However, in the second case, the game declare a function pointer,
 * and link the function inside the library to it at runtime.
 * Then the game can call the function using its pointer.
 * In this case, writing a function with the same name is not enough.
 *
 * One solution to this is to hook the functions that perform
 * the dynamic library loading. Then, if the game try to load
 * a function from a shared library, we will first try to load
 * the function from inside the program first. If we found one,
 * it is probably our custom function. By linking to it,
 * the program will call our function instead of the function
 * from the shared library.

 * For hooking functions that perform dynamic library loading,
 * we have to use a special method.
 * Indeed, we cannot use dlsym to get the original function
 * because we are hooking dlsym itself.
 * Solution comes from this post:
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/18825060
 * which is using the internal _dl_sym function for dynamic library loading
 * However, this internal function is much more unsafe, so we are only using it
 * to access to the real dlsym function, and we use that function everything else.
